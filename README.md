IThe desire to have an app (IOS only for now) that worked in symbiosis with DanielFett's work inspired me to the point of having created the right interface for all Truma Combi™ users.

What in my opinion was needed to make the "inetbox.py" application that runs on Raspberry PI really usable was a native app that could allow both local and remote access to Truma management.

I used a Raspberry PI Zero 2W
